        <div><h2 class="heading heading-right">Benefits Of Yoga</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="yoga-icon">Improved Flexibility: Yoga involves various poses and stretches that help increase
                    flexibility by loosening tight muscles and increasing the range of motion in joints.
                </li>

                <li class="yoga-icon">Stress Reduction and Relaxation: Through the combination of breathwork,
                    meditation, and physical movements, yoga helps reduce stress, promotes relaxation, and enhances
                    mental clarity and calmness.
                </li>

                <li class="yoga-icon">Strength Building: Many yoga poses require engaging and holding bodyweight, which
                    helps in building strength in various muscle groups over time.
                </li>

                <li class="yoga-icon">Better Posture and Balance: Practicing yoga helps improve posture by strengthening
                    core muscles and increasing body awareness, which, in turn, enhances balance and stability.
                </li>

                <li class="yoga-icon">Enhanced Mind-Body Connection: Yoga encourages mindfulness, fostering a deeper
                    connection between the mind and body. This awareness can lead to better self-understanding,
                    emotional balance, and overall well-being.
