                <h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
            </header>
            <article class="layout">
                <p> Yoga, an ancient practice rooted in spiritual, mental, and physical discipline,
                    traces its origins back thousands of years in India. </p>
                <p>Its beginnings can be found in the sacred texts known as the Vedas, particularly the Rigveda,
                    where the concept of yoga was first mentioned.</p>
                <p>The evolution of yoga spans centuries, drawing from various traditions, philosophies, and teachings.
                    It wasn't until around 500 BCE that the systematic codification of yoga practices occurred,
                    primarily attributed to the sage Patanjali, who compiled the Yoga Sutras. </p>
                <p>These sutras, comprised of aphorisms or principles, outlined the eightfold path of yoga,
                    own as Ashtanga Yoga, providing guidance on ethical principles, physical postures (asanas),
                    breath control (pranayama), meditation,
                    and spiritual development.
                <p>Over time, yoga has transformed and diversified into various styles and
                    approaches, gaining popularity worldwide as a means to achieve holistic well-being, inner peace, and
                    harmony between mind, body, and spirit. Its timeless wisdom continues to resonate and adapt in modern
                    society, offering a pathway to self-discovery and overall wellness.

                <ul>
                    <li class="yoga-icon">Improved Flexibility: Yoga involves various poses and stretches that help increase
                        flexibility by loosening tight muscles and increasing the range of motion in joints.
                    </li>

                    <li class="yoga-icon">Stress Reduction and Relaxation: Through the combination of breathwork,
                        meditation, and physical movements, yoga helps reduce stress, promotes relaxation, and enhances
                        mental clarity and calmness.
                    </li>

                    <li class="yoga-icon">Strength Building: Many yoga poses require engaging and holding bodyweight, which
                        helps in building strength in various muscle groups over time.
                    </li>

                    <li class="yoga-icon">Better Posture and Balance: Practicing yoga helps improve posture by strengthening
                        core muscles and increasing body awareness, which, in turn, enhances balance and stability.
                    </li>

                    <li class="yoga-icon">Enhanced Mind-Body Connection: Yoga encourages mindfulness, fostering a deeper
                        connection between the mind and body. This awareness can lead to better self-understanding,
                        emotional balance, and overall well-being.
