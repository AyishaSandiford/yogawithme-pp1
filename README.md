- Hero-Image

This image was carefully selected as it shows a lady sitting in 
a tradition yoga poses with her eyes closed and hands open at both her sides
in a forest. The image gives the feeling 
that the lady is embracing nature, becoming one with all 
that's around her. For me this image represents where Yoga
can take you through practice.
