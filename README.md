# Common Features

---
+ The Navigation Bar 
  - The navigation bar takes a common design across all four pages in keeping with convention. The logo is placed on the upper left side of the page and the four pages (Home, studio ... etc.) are displayed to the immediate  right 
  - The navigation bar consists of the Home, Studio, About Us and Contact Us pages. (There is also a feedback form page, However this is only displayed after filling out the contact form and clicking on the submit button )
  - Links are included on all four of the page tiles including the logo. These titles link to their respective pages for easy navigation. The logo links back to the homepage as a typical shortcut users may be familiar with.
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive. For smaller screens, the hamburger icon will appear and the logo centered on the page. Once the icon is clicked a dropdown menu of all four pages will be visible to the user. A horizontal line will appear under the users current page in this view
  - For tablets, desktops and larger devices the navigation bar displays the title as stated in the second bullet above. (This was achieved using "white-space: nowrap" as a style to the media). A horizontal line appears under the current page as a visual indicator to the user indicating which page they are currently on. Titles have a change of colour and a line appearing underneath them once hovered to visually indicate to users that they are clickable.

 ## Hero-Image


This image was carefully selected as it shows a lady sitting in 
a traditional yoga pose with her eyes closed and hands open to her sides
in a forest with a halo of light shining upon her. The image gives the feeling 
that the lady is embracing nature, becoming one with all 
that's around her. For me this image represents where Yoga
can take you through practice.

![Hero image ](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-hero-image.png)

- Footer
  - The footer design is consistent throughout all pages on this site
  - The footer is made up of a grey background which includes logo links to each of the social media platforms. These are equally spaced across the footer. This provides the user with a visual call to action to prompt them into visiting the organisation's social media profiles.
  - When clicked, these links will take you to the login page of the corresponding social media page.

## HomePage Features

---
The Home page welcomes the user to the site. It then gives a short summary 
of Yoga and it's origin. Below this, a video was added giving more detail 
about this.

![Welcome](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-welcome.png)

### This introductory video dives deeper into the meaning of yoga. It gives the user a better understanding on the true nature of yoga

![What is yoga video](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-what-is-yoga-video.png)

### With a border around each list. The site goes on to list just a few type of people that can get started with yoga.

### Three images are evenly stretched across the page with a brief encouraging note below to match each image.

   for beginners
- The user will move on to a 40min video for those who may be willing to try something a bit more challenging.
- Lastly, a stretch is provided as it is important after exercising 
- In these videos you are taught how to breath and provided with expert tips and knowledge

![Screenshot-instructors.png](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-instructors.png)

## The About Us page

- This page layout shows the who-we-are text aligned to the left and an image to its immediate right. This layout is reversed when displaying the Our-Goal section below. A light grey background color helps differentiate between the two summaries allowing a better reading experience.

![Who we are](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-who-we-are.png)

- Who-we-are summary gives the User an insight on the life of Emily Stuart the Founder of YogaWithMe and how she first fell in love with Yoga and started this company. (The name Emily Stuart was created only to add a name to this story)
- Our-Goal summary is positioned directly below the Who-we-are summary. This informs the reader of the Founder's goal and what you can expect from the practice.

![Our goal](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-our-goal.png)

The contact form provides users with the ability to contact the YogaWithMe team directly with any queries or comments they may have. The user is asked to fill in their full name, email address, subject and the content of their message.

## Testing

Testing was performed with the following devices/browsers:

- Desktop computer: (2560 x 1440) display
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- MacBook Pro: 13.3-inch (2560 × 1600) display
- Google Chrome
- iPad Pro: (2732 x 2048) display

I also utilised the Chrome and Firefox developer tools to
simulate the display on other devices and test the responsiveness of the site.

## Bugs and Fixes


1. - Issue Found: 
       - I wanted to reverse the order of the text and image displayed on the our-goal section. Placing the image to the left of the page and the text to the right. 
    - Causes:
        - The computer reads the web pages from left to right. However, I needed the computer to read the text first even though it was displayed to the left and the image to the right. 
   - Solution Found:
        - After some research I found out that I could  use reverse "flex-direction: row-reverse" and this would allow the computer to see the text as being more important and read it first. 


2. - Issue Found:
      - After using the Wave tool there was an error indicated on the nav-toggle.
   - Cause:
      - There was an input that didn't have an associated label.
   - Solution Found: 
       - I added a label and styled the visibility as hidden

- Lighthouse

I generated a lighthouse report on both desktop and mobile view. The Performance low score is due to the embedded youtube videos used on my site. 
Solution - This can be resolved by adding a placeholder so that the page can load more quickly and then using javascript to dynamically add the embedded YouTube iframe to the page.

![Screenshot-lighthouse-report-one.png](docs/screenshots/Screenshot-lighthouse-report-one.png)


Below is the score of the lighthouse generated report of the About Us page
No videos were used on this page. This report was good.
