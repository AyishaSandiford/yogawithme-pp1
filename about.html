                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to our space dedicated to the beautiful journey of yoga! Our founder,
                    Emily Stuart, a single parent whose body underwent significant changes after the birth of
                    her son, discovered the transformative power of yoga through a friend's
                    introduction. Unsure of where to begin or how to muster motivation,
                    she found her stride by embracing group yoga sessions, realizing the immense
                    impact they had on her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this journey, she unearthed a profound sense of unity with the
                    universe, experiencing a tangible transformation in both body and mind.
                    This newfound harmony led her to a place where she feels incredible—physically,
                    mentally, and spiritually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Determined to share this life-changing practice with others, she and her team
                    envisioned a space where anyone and everyone could access yoga easily and freely.
                    Thus, this website was born—a hub offering live sessions, ensuring that
                    yoga's wealth of benefits is available to all, welcoming individuals from
                    every walk of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We invite you to join us on this empowering journey toward holistic well-being.
                    Embrace the union of mind, body, and spirit as we navigate the beautiful
                    practice of yoga together. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned
                    practitioner, our aim is to make yoga accessible, enjoyable, and
                    transformative for everyone.

            <h3> Our Goal </h3>
            <p>
                At YogaWithMe, our goal is simple yet profound: to make the life-enriching
                practice of yoga accessible to everyone. We believe that yoga isn't just a set of
                poses; it's a pathway to holistic well-being—a journey that can transform lives
                physically, mentally, and spiritually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to break down barriers and provide a welcoming space where
                individuals of all backgrounds, experiences, and abilities can explore and embrace
                yoga without limitations. Through live sessions offered free of charge, we aim to
                dissolve any obstacles that might hinder someone from embarking on this
                transformative journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aspire to create a supportive community where the benefits of yoga—flexibility,
                strength, mindfulness, and inner peace—are within reach for all. Whether you're a
                curious beginner seeking guidance or an experienced practitioner looking to deepen
                your practice, our platform is designed to meet you wherever you are on your yoga
                journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us as we pave the way toward a more inclusive and harmonious world,
                one where yoga is a universally accessible tool for enhancing both physical
                health and inner serenity. Together, let's breathe, stretch, and find
                alignment—uniting mind, body, and spirit on the path to wellness.
